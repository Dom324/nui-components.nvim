Hello there! My name is Marcin Dziewulski, also known as [@mobily](https://github.com/mobily), and I would be delighted to invite you to explore my personal workspace for open-source projects, [Grapp](https://github.com/grapp-dev).

At <span className="grapp">Grapp</span>, I want to share my ideas and experience with various programming languages, technologies, and patterns such as TypeScript, Ruby, Lua, ReScript, React Native, Functional Programming, and Functional Reactive Programming. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my work and help others.

In my free time, I create and maintain open-source projects like [Stacks](https://github.com/mobily/stacks), a set of useful components for building and maintaining React Native layouts, [ts-belt](https://github.com/mobily/ts-belt), a fast, modern, and practical utility library for FP in TypeScript, and [nui-components.nvim](https://github.com/grapp-dev/nui-components.nvim), a highly customizable library for creating user interfaces in Neovim.

I plan to update all my created libraries and move them to the <span className="grapp">Grapp</span> organization. I also want to create and share more useful libraries for the community.

If you think my work is helpful, I would appreciate it if you could support me here on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/mobily). Additionally, you can choose a membership plan to continuously support my work and help me spend more time contributing to the open-source community.

I would love for you to chat with me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tSvmWuEHVp). I'm always there to help, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
