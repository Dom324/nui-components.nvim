## What is NuiComponents?

NuiComponents is a library built on top of [`nui.nvim`](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim), which provides an extensive set of tools for creating user interfaces in Neovim using Lua. With NuiComponents, developers can easily build complex UIs using a simple and intuitive API, which supports various UI elements such as buttons, text input, checkboxes, selectors, forms, tabs, spinners, and rows/columns layouts. Moreover, the library includes advanced features like state management and form validations.

NuiComponents is a powerful tool that aims to make UI development in Neovim more accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable. One of the most significant advantages of NuiComponents is its high level of customization. Developers can modify the appearance and behavior of UI components using props and events. Furthermore, the library is designed to be highly extensible, making it easy to add new components or modify existing ones. With its rich set of features and flexibility, it is a great choice for anyone looking to create functional UIs in Neovim.

## Key Features

### Reactive UI

NuiComponents enables developers to build reactive user interfaces by providing a declarative approach. The library automatically handles updates and changes based on input and events received, making it easy to create UIs that adapt to user interactions.

### Flexbox

NuiComponents supports a simple flexbox layout system, which provides a more flexible way to layout UIs.

### State Management

NuiComponents provides a simple yet powerful state management system that allows developers to easily manage data and UI state. This feature ensures that the UI stays in sync with the underlying data and updates automatically when the state changes.

### Extensibility

NuiComponents is designed to be highly extensible, making it easy to add new components or modify existing ones. Developers can create their own custom components by defining their properties and events.

### Reusability

NuiComponents encourages component reusability. Developers can easily reuse components between different parts of their UI, reducing the amount of code they need to write and making it easier to maintain code over time.
